# Sync a Private Repo Subfolder to a Public Repo Using GitHub Actions

This guide walks you through everything from scratch — creating both repos, setting up permissions, and automating the sync so any change (including deletions) in your private repo's subfolder automatically reflects in your public repo.

---

## What We Are Building

```
Private Repo (obsidian-data)
└── website/                ← only this folder gets synced
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── blogs/
        └── post.md

Public Repo (website-content)
├── index.html              ← mirrors website/ folder exactly
├── style.css
└── blogs/
    └── post.md
```

Whenever you push a change to the `website/` folder in your private repo, GitHub Actions will automatically copy those changes to your public repo — including deletions.

---

## Step 1: Create the Private Repo (Repo A)

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in
2. Click the **+** icon at the top right → **New repository**
3. Fill in:
    - **Repository name:** `obsidian-data`
    - **Visibility:** Select **Private**
    - Check **Add a README file** (so the repo is not empty)
4. Click **Create repository**

Now create the `website` folder inside it:

1. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
2. In the filename box type: `website/readme.md`
    - Typing the `/` automatically creates the folder
3. Add any content like `# My Website`
4. Click **Commit new file**

---

## Step 2: Create the Public Repo (Repo B)

1. Click **+** → **New repository**
2. Fill in:
    - **Repository name:** `website-content`
    - **Visibility:** Select **Public**
    - Check **Add a README file**
3. Click **Create repository**

> ⚠️ The public repo must have at least one commit (not be completely empty) otherwise the sync will fail. The README file handles this.

---

## Step 3: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

The GitHub Action in your private repo needs permission to push to your public repo. You give it this permission through a Personal Access Token.

1. Click your **profile picture** (top right)
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll all the way down on the left sidebar → click **Developer settings**
4. Click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
5. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
6. Fill in:
    - **Note:** `sync-obsidian-to-website` (a label so you remember what it is)
    - **Expiration:** Choose `No expiration` or set a date
    - **Scopes:** Check the box next to `repo` (the top-level one — this gives full repo read/write access)
7. Scroll down → click **Generate token**
8. **COPY THE TOKEN NOW** — it starts with `ghp_...` and you will never see it again after leaving this page. Save it in Notepad temporarily.

---

## Step 4: Add the Token as a Secret in Repo A

You store the token as a secret so GitHub Actions can use it securely without exposing it in your code.

1. Go to your **private repo** (`obsidian-data`)
2. Click the **Settings** tab (inside the repo, not your account settings)
3. On the left sidebar click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Fill in:
    - **Name:** `SYNC_TOKEN`
    - **Secret:** Paste the token you copied in Step 3
6. Click **Add secret**

You should now see `SYNC_TOKEN` listed. The value is hidden and encrypted — nobody can read it, but GitHub Actions can use it.

---

## Step 5: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

This is the automation file that does the actual syncing.

1. Go to your **private repo** (`obsidian-data`)
2. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
3. In the filename box type exactly: `.github/workflows/sync.yml`
    - GitHub will create the `.github` and `workflows` folders automatically as you type the slashes
4. Paste the following content:

```yaml
name: Sync website to public repo

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'website/**'

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo A
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Clone Repo B
        env:
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SYNC_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          git config --global credential.helper store
          echo "https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:${TOKEN}@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials
          git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/website-content.git repo-b

      - name: Sync website folder (with deletes)
        run: |
          rsync -av --delete --exclude='.git' website/ repo-b/

      - name: Commit and push to Repo B
        run: |
          cd repo-b
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add -A
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "Sync from obsidian-data: ${{ github.sha }}"
          git push
```

5. **Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`** in two places with your actual GitHub username. For example if your username is `john`:
    
    - `echo "https://vineel:${TOKEN}@github.com"`
    - `git clone https://github.com/john/website-content.git repo-b`
6. Scroll down → click **Commit new file**
    

---

## Step 6: Understanding the Workflow (What Each Part Does)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'website/**'
```

This means the workflow only runs when a file inside the `website/` folder is changed. It won't trigger for changes outside that folder.

---

```yaml
git config --global credential.helper store
echo "https://YOUR_USERNAME:${TOKEN}@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials
```

This stores your token in git's credential system so all git operations (clone, push) use your token automatically.

---

```yaml
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/website-content.git repo-b
```

Downloads your public repo into a local folder called `repo-b` on the Actions runner machine.

---

```yaml
rsync -av --delete --exclude='.git' website/ repo-b/
```

Copies everything from your `website/` folder into `repo-b/`. The `--delete` flag is what makes deletions sync — if you delete a file in `website/`, rsync removes it from `repo-b/` too.

---

```yaml
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "..."
```

This is a safety check — if there are no changes, it skips the commit so the workflow doesn't fail unnecessarily.

---

## Step 7: Work Locally on Your Computer

You can clone the private repo to your computer, make changes to files inside the `website/` folder, and push to GitHub as you normally would. Every time you push, GitHub Actions will automatically sync those changes to the public repo `website-content` — including any files you deleted.
## Step 8: Test That It Works

### Test adding a file

1. Go to your **private repo** (`obsidian-data`)
2. Navigate into the `website/` folder
3. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
4. Name it `test.md` and add some content
5. Click **Commit new file**
6. Go to the **Actions** tab of your private repo
7. You should see a workflow run called **"Sync website to public repo"** running
8. Click on it — you can watch the live logs
9. Once it shows a green ✅, go to your **public repo** (`website-content`) and verify `test.md` is there

### Test deleting a file

1. In your private repo, go into `website/` and open `test.md`
2. Click the **trash icon** (Delete file)
3. Commit the deletion
4. Watch the Actions tab — the workflow runs
5. Go to your public repo — `test.md` should be gone

---

## Step 10: Your Folder Structure

After setup your private repo will look like this:

```
obsidian-data/                    ← private repo root
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── sync.yml              ← the automation file
├── website/                      ← THIS folder syncs to public repo
│   ├── index.html
│   └── blogs/
│       └── post.md
└── other-private-stuff/          ← this does NOT sync anywhere
    └── notes.md
```

Only the `website/` folder gets synced. Everything else in `obsidian-data` stays private.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Workflow doesn't appear in Actions tab?**

- Make sure you committed the `sync.yml` file to the default branch (usually `main`)
- Make sure the change you pushed was inside the `website/` folder

**403 Permission denied error on push?**

- Your PAT token may not have the `repo` scope — regenerate it with full `repo` scope checked
- Make sure `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in the workflow file matches your actual GitHub username exactly (case-sensitive)
- Delete the old `SYNC_TOKEN` secret and add it again with the new token

**Files going into wrong folder in public repo?**

- Make sure the rsync line is `website/ repo-b/` — the trailing slashes matter
- Make sure all git commands are inside `cd repo-b` step

**Workflow runs but nothing changes in public repo?**

- Check the Actions logs — look for any error in red
- Make sure your public repo (`website-content`) is not empty — it needs at least one commit

**Workflow triggered but says "nothing to commit"?**

- This is fine — it means the public repo already has the latest files. Make an actual change and try again.

## Summary

| Step | What You Did                                                    |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Created private repo `obsidian-data` with a `website/` folder   |
| 2    | Created public repo `website-content`                           |
| 3    | Generated a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope             |
| 4    | Added the token as a secret called `SYNC_TOKEN` in private repo |
| 5    | Created `.github/workflows/sync.yml` with the sync automation   |
| 6    | Understood what each part of the workflow does                  |
| 7    | Cloned the private repo to your local computer                  |
| 8    | Made changes locally and pushed to trigger the sync             |
| 9    | Tested adding and deleting files                                |

From now on, every time you push changes to the `website/` folder in `obsidian-data`, GitHub Actions will automatically mirror those changes — including deletions — to `website-content`.
